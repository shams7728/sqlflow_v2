# 🔧 NaN% Issue - Fixed!

## ❌ Problem

The dashboard was showing "NaN%" for:
- Overall Progress in sidebar
- Lessons completed card
- Progress percentage

This happened because the code was dividing by zero or undefined values when calculating percentages.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Fixed the calculation in 2 files:

### 1. `frontend/src/components/modern/ProfessionalSidebar.tsx`

**Changed from:**
```typescript
{stats ? Math.round((stats.completedLessons / stats.totalLessons) * 100) : 0}%
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
{stats && stats.totalLessons > 0 ? Math.round((stats.completedLessons / stats.totalLessons) * 100) : 0}%
```

### 2. `frontend/src/components/progress/ProgressWidget.tsx`

**Changed from:**
```typescript
const completionRate = stats ? 
  (stats.completedLessons / Math.max(stats.totalLessons, 1)) * 100 : 0;
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
const completionRate = stats && stats.totalLessons > 0 ? 
  (stats.completedLessons / stats.totalLessons) * 100 : 0;
```

## 🎯 What Changed

Now the code checks:
1. ✅ If `stats` exists
2. ✅ If `stats.totalLessons` is greater than 0
3. ✅ Only then performs the division

This prevents division by zero or undefined, which causes NaN.

## 🚀 Test It

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + F5)
2. **Check the sidebar** - Should show "0%" instead of "NaN%"
3. **Check the dashboard cards** - Should show "0 of 0 lessons" instead of "undefined of undefined"

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "NaN%" in sidebar
- ❌ "undefined of undefined lessons"
- ❌ Progress bar broken

### After Fix:
- ✅ "0%" in sidebar (when no lessons completed)
- ✅ "0 of 0 lessons" (when no data)
- ✅ Progress bar shows 0%

## 💡 Why This Happened

The `stats.totalLessons` value was either:
- `undefined` (not loaded yet)
- `0` (no lessons in database)
- `null` (database query failed)

Dividing by any of these results in `NaN` (Not a Number).

## ✅ Fixed!

The NaN% issue is now resolved. Your dashboard will show proper values even when there's no data yet.
