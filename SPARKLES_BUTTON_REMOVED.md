# ✅ Sparkles Button Removed

## Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Removed sparkles button** from `App.tsx`
2. ✅ **Removed SparklesIcon import** - Cleaned up unused import

## What Was Removed:

The floating button with sparkles icon that was in the bottom-right corner:
```tsx
<button className="w-12 h-12 sm:w-14 sm:h-14 bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-500 to-primary-600 text-white rounded-full...">
  <SparklesIcon />
</button>
```

## What Remains:

- ✅ **FeedbackButton** (from App.js) - Your feedback form button

## 🚀 To See the Change:

**Refresh your browser:**
```
F5
```

Or hard refresh:
```
Ctrl + Shift + F5
```

## 📍 Current Floating Buttons:

Now you should have **only ONE** floating button:
- **Feedback Button** (Material-UI Fab with Feedback icon)
  - Opens dialog for bug reports, suggestions, and feedback
  - Sends submissions to your email via Formspree

## ✅ Clean Interface:

- No more sparkles button
- No more HelpFab
- Just one clean feedback button

**Refresh your browser to see the single feedback button!** 🎉
