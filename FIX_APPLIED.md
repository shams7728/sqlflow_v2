# 🔧 Fix Applied - Auth Middleware Issue

## ❌ Error Fixed

**Error was:**
```
TypeError: argument handler must be a function
at Route.<computed> [as post] (backend/routes/notifications.js:11:8)
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

The issue was that the auth middleware exports an object with named exports, but the notifications route was trying to use it as a default export.

**Changed from:**
```javascript
const auth = require('../middleware/auth');
router.post('/test', auth, async (req, res) => {
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
const { authenticateToken, optionalAuth } = require('../middleware/auth');
router.post('/test', optionalAuth, async (req, res) => {
```

## 🚀 Try Again

Now restart your backend server:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
✅ Local MongoDB Connected successfully
```

No more errors! 🎉

## 📝 What Changed

- ✅ Fixed auth middleware import in `backend/routes/notifications.js`
- ✅ Changed all routes to use `optionalAuth` (allows guest users)
- ✅ All 5 notification routes updated

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Start backend (should work now)
2. Start frontend
3. Add OneSignal components to App.js (see `ADD_ONESIGNAL_TO_APP.md`)
4. Test notifications!

**The backend should start without errors now!** 🚀
