# ✅ HelpFab Removed - FeedbackButton Only

## Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Removed HelpFab** - Old blue help button removed

## What You'll See Now:

## 🎯 Single Floating Button:

Now you have **only one** floating button:
- **Feedback Button** (bottom-right corner)
- Allows users to:
  - 🐛 Report bugs
  - 💡 Submit suggestions
  - ⭐ Give general feedback

2. Dialog opens with form
3. User selects type (Bug/Suggestion/Feedback)
4. User fills in details
5. User clicks "Send"
6. You receive email via Formspree!
