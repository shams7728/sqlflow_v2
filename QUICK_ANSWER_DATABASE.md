# Quick Answer: Database Files

## ❓ Your Question
"If I don't upload database files, will there be a problem on Render?"

## ✅ Answer
**YES, there will be a problem!** Your app will crash because it needs those `.db` files to run SQL queries.

## 🎯 Solution
**Upload the .db files** - They're safe because they contain lesson content, not user data.

## ✨ What I Did
Updated your `.gitignore` to **allow** lesson database files:
- ✅ `backend/lesson-data/*.db` files will now be uploaded
- ❌ Other database files still excluded

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

```bash
# Add the database files
git add backend/lesson-data/*.db

# Commit
git commit -m "Add lesson database files"

# Push
git push origin main
```

## 🔒 Is This Safe?

**YES!** These files contain:
- ✅ Lesson content (like a textbook)
- ✅ Sample data for learning
- ✅ No user information
- ✅ No passwords or secrets

Think of them like images or PDFs - they're content files, not sensitive data.

## 📊 File Sizes

Check your database sizes:
```bash
ls -lh backend/lesson-data/*.db
```

If total is under 100MB, you're good to upload!

**Bottom line:** Upload the .db files. Your app needs them to work on Render! 🎉
