# 🎨 Logo Fixed - Modern Login/Register Pages

## ✅ Issue Found and Fixed!

The terminal icon (CommandLineIcon) was being used in the **Modern** login and register pages, not the regular ones.

### Files Updated:

1. ✅ **`frontend/src/components/auth/ModernLoginPage.tsx`**
   - Replaced CommandLineIcon with database-table.png

2. ✅ **`frontend/src/components/auth/ModernRegisterPage.tsx`**
   - Replaced CommandLineIcon with database-table.png

### What Changed:

**Before:**
```tsx
<CommandLineIcon className="w-7 h-7 text-white" />
```

**After:**
```tsx
<img src="/assests/database-table.png" alt="SQL-Flow Logo" className="w-full h-full object-contain" />
```

## 🚀 To See the New Logo:

1. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + F5
   ```

2. **Or clear cache:**
   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + Delete
   → Clear cached images and files
   → Clear data
   ```

3. **Then refresh:**
   ```
   F5
   ```

## 📍 Where You'll See It:

- ✅ Login page (left side with purple background)
- ✅ Register page (left side with green background)
- ✅ All headers and sidebars

## 💡 Why It Didn't Work Before:

Your app uses **two different login pages**:
1. Regular LoginPage.jsx (already had correct logo)
2. **ModernLoginPage.tsx** (was using CommandLineIcon) ← This is what you're seeing!

The modern pages are the ones being used, so that's where the terminal icon was coming from.

## ✅ All Fixed Now!

The database table logo will now appear everywhere, including the modern login/register pages!
