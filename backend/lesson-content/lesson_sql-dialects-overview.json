These different versions are known as 'dialects'. Common dialects include T-SQL (Microsoft SQL Server), PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL), PL/SQL (Oracle), and the simpler SQL used by MySQL and SQLite."

            "type": "paragraph",

Why do dialects exist?\nDialects exist because database vendors add their own proprietary extensions and functions to the standard SQL to provide more features or to optimize performance on their specific system. This leads to differences in syntax, data types, and available functions."

Understanding these differences is key to writing portable code or migrating from one database to another."
