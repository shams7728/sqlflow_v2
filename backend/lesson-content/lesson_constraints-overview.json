        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. Why are they so important?\nConstraints are the bedrock of data integrity. They prevent invalid data from being entered into the database. For example, a `NOT NULL` constraint prevents empty values, and a `UNIQUE` constraint prevents duplicate entries, which are critical for maintaining a clean and trustworthy dataset."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. Where are they defined?\nConstraints can be specified when a table is created with the `CREATE TABLE` statement, or they can be added to an existing table using the `ALTER TABLE` statement."
