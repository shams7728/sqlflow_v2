            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. How is it different from DELETE?\n`TRUNCATE` is generally much faster than `DELETE FROM table_name;` as it deallocates the data pages directly and doesn't log each row deletion. `DELETE` removes rows one by one. However, `TRUNCATE` cannot be used with a `WHERE` clause."
