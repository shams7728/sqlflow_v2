What are the main types of backups?\nThere are two main categories: **Physical backups** copy the actual data files, making for a very fast restore. **Logical backups** export the data into a file (like a `.sql` script containing `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements), which is more flexible but slower to restore."

A backup is useless without a tested recovery plan."
