            "type": "paragraph",

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. How does it work?\nWhen you execute `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`, the database management system (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server) allocates disk space and creates the necessary system files to manage the new database. You only need to provide a unique name for it."
