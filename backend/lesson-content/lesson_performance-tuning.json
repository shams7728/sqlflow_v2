            "text": "1. What is Performance Tuning?\nPerformance tuning is the process of optimizing SQL queries to make them run faster and more efficiently. On large datasets, a poorly written query can take minutes or even hours, while a well-tuned query can return the same result in seconds."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. What is an Execution Plan?\nAn execution plan (or query plan) is the sequence of steps that the database's query optimizer generates to access data. By analyzing the execution plan (often using a command like `EXPLAIN`), you can identify bottlenecks, such as full table scans, and understand how your query is actually being run."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "3. What is the most important tool for performance?\nIndexes. Properly created indexes are the single most effective tool for improving query speed. An index allows the database to find the data it needs directly, avoiding a costly 'full table scan' where it has to read every single row."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "4. What does 'SARGable' mean?\nA query is 'SARGable' (Search-Argument-Able) if the database can use an index to speed it up. A common mistake is to use a function on an indexed column in the `WHERE` clause (e.g., `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2025`). This often prevents the database from using the index. The SARGable alternative would be `WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01' AND order_date < '2026-01-01'`."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "5. Why should I avoid `SELECT *`?\nSelecting all columns with `*` can hurt performance, especially on tables with many columns or large data types (like TEXT or BLOB). It increases network traffic and memory usage. You should always specify only the columns you actually need."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "6. How do JOINs affect performance?\nPoorly written JOINs are a major source of performance problems. Ensure that the columns used in your `ON` clauses are indexed (especially foreign keys). The order of joins can also matter, though modern query optimizers are very good at figuring out the most efficient join order."

            "type": "note",
