The goal is to divide larger tables into smaller, well-structured tables and define relationships between them. This reduces the risk of data anomalies (like update, insertion, and deletion anomalies)."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "2. What is Denormalization?\nDenormalization is the opposite process. It involves intentionally adding redundant data to one or more tables. This is done to improve query performance by avoiding the need for complex joins between tables, which can be slow."

            "type": "paragraph",

Normalization prioritizes data integrity and reduces redundancy, but it can lead to slower queries that require many joins. Denormalization prioritizes fast query performance (fewer joins) at the cost of data redundancy and a higher risk of data anomalies."
